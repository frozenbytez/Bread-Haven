# Bread-Haven
I have created a website called "Bread Haven" which is dedicated to showcasing different types of bread and their recipes. Here's an overview of what I have built:

Home Page (index.html): This is the main landing page of the website. It features the Bread Haven logo, a navigation menu, and a welcoming message inviting visitors to explore the different types of bread available on the site.

Types of Bread (types.html): This page displays a grid of different bread types, such as sourdough, baguette, whole wheat, rye bread, brioche, ciabatta, focaccia, and naan. Each bread type is represented by an image, name, and a brief description. The page also includes a search input field that allows users to filter the bread types based on their search query.

Bread Detail Pages: For each bread type, there is a dedicated page that provides more detailed information. These pages typically include:

The bread's name and an image
A list of ingredients required for the recipe
A video tutorial embedded from YouTube
Step-by-step instructions for making the bread
About Us (about.html): This page provides information about the Bread Haven website, its mission, and its commitment to sharing knowledge about different types of bread from around the world.

Consistent Design and Styling: The website has a consistent design and styling applied across all pages. The CSS file (styles.css) contains rules for typography, layout, colors, and responsive design.

Overall, my website is a comprehensive resource for bread enthusiasts, offering a wide range of bread types, recipes, and instructional videos. The design is visually appealing and user-friendly, with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The use of HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript contributes to creating an engaging and informative experience for visitors.
